The password algorithm came from thinking of it as a thin-toothed (think needle) key trying to fit into a lock with wide pins where the distance between the pins represents time. The width of the pins can be changed behind the scenes, and whatever rhythm you want can be subsituted in, but hopefully you like my choice!
