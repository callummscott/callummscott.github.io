# Changes

- Much improved the responsiveness for landscape view on mobile
    - Managed to add a linearly changing height of `title-border-svg` to make more room for the chopping board for slimmer views.
- Changed title-input colours: darkened when hovering feels more appropriate


# Bug-watch
- Widths < 340px seem to weirdly shrink the background image on Mobile, but not on Desktop; maybe worth looking into
