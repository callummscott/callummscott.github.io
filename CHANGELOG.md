# Changes

- I think the pesky bug has been fixed now, we'll see
- Removed multiple pointless references to 95% width chopping-board
- Added adaptive (100vw) search-bar formatting for landscape mobile viewports
- Changed background image orientation to be device-orientation-dependent instead of width-dependent
